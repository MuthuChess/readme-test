# PIC18F47Q10 Hello World

## Objective
-----

>In this project, an LED (Light Emitting Diode) is turned on by the PIC18F47Q10 microcontroller >using the Curiosity nano (Q10) development board platform. This is a great starting point for getting your Curiosity nano board running.

## Procedure
-----

>The PIC18F47Q10 GPIO pin RE0, connected to LED0 on the Curiosity nano - Q10 board, is setup as an output to control the LED.

>The project uses: [PIC18F47Q10 Microcontoller](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/PIC18F47Q10)

>To follow along with these steps, MPLABÂ® Xpress cloud based IDE should be open. The setup is described in the steps of this training module. You should see a screen similar to the one shown here to start.
